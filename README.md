# Bash completion collection

The files in this folder just have to be dropped into the bash completion folder usually
to be found at ``/etc/bash_completion.d`` within a Linux installation - package *bash-completion* on
Debian -.
As an alternative, it could be copied into the file ``$HOME/.bash_completion``.
The ox bash completions automatically add ``/opt/open-xchange/sbin`` into the ``PATH``.

Packages for various distributions are built in the Open Build Service and can be downloaded via http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/OX:/bash-completion/
